# Exploring MDX Components with GitHub Flavored Markdown

MDX (Markdown with JSX) is a powerful way to write content using Markdown syntax while also enabling you to include React components. In this post, we'll explore how to use Markdown and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features that map to HTML components.

## Headings

Markdown supports various heading levels:

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
### This is an H3
#### This is an H4
##### This is an H5
###### This is an H6

## Paragraphs

Regular text in Markdown automatically converts to paragraphs.

This is a paragraph using standard Markdown.

## Lists

You can create unordered and ordered lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

## Blockquotes

You can create blockquotes by using the `>` character:

> This is a blockquote in Markdown.

## Code Blocks

Inline code is enclosed in backticks: `code example`.

For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks:

```js
const example = () => {
  console.log("This is a code block");
};
```

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis with _italics_, **bold**, or ***bold italics***.

## Horizontal Rule

To create a horizontal rule, use three hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

---
***
___

## Links and Images

You can add links like this: [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com).

To insert an image, use the following syntax:

![Alt text for image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

## Tables

You can create tables using GitHub Flavored Markdown:

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Data 1   | Data 2   |
| Row 2    | Data 3   | Data 4   |

## Task Lists

GFM also supports task lists:

- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## Strikethrough

Use `~~` to create strikethrough text:

~~This text is strikethrough.~~

## Footnotes

You can also add footnotes in MDX[^1].

[^1]: This is a footnote.
