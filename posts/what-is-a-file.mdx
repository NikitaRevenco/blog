I had been using Windows for most of my life. I didn't know much about files -- I thought that files are just what programs use to store their data (e.g. Notepad using `.txt` extension, Photoshop with its `.psd`, etc.)

I assumed that a file's purpose is _defined by its extension_. And this conclusion made sense to me at the time, since for example I couldn't open a `.mp4` file format in Photoshop.

When I started using Linux, I made an experiment. For example if I have just a simple JavaScript `file.js` like this:

```js title="file.js" showLineNumbers
console.log("Hello World!");
```

Then running it with `node file.js` would output `Hello World!` in the terminal. But what confused me, was that when I tried to remove the extension completely:

```_ title="file" showLineNumbers
console.log("Hello World!");
```

Running `node file` would still output the same string. So this was insightful to me, at this point I realised that the purpose of files is **not** defined by their extension -- rather, its the _program itself_ that decides how to read a specific file.

So it seems that file extensions are only for semantic purposes. If I open a `file.js` in an IDE like Visual Studio Code, it'll know which highlighter to use, and that for example certain keywords like `import{:js}`, `const{:js}` should be highlighted. But the extension isn't strictly required.

Okay, so that's interesting. But when I switched from Ubuntu to Arch Linux, I had to manually set up my partitions during the installation. For example a Windows `C:\` drive may be the equivalent to `/dev/sda` in Linux. And this `/dev/sda` may be divided into separate chunks called "partitions".
